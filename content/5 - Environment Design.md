# Part 1 - Game World Design

## Terminology

There are two important disciplines when it comes to Game World Design. They will define how the environment will look like, as well as how the player can interact with them. These two disciplines are...


### World Design

This encompasses the overall mood and lore of the game. Genre, time period and theme should all be considered here.

From this, a top-level map could be created, resolving around the central goal of the playable characters.


### Level Design

This one is concerned with the level, the immediate space in which the player can play. Where are they? What can they do?

Ideally, a level designer would guide the player through the objectives using objects and obstacles in the environment.



Essentially, World Design is the overarching world, story and lore, while Level Design is only concerned with the individual rooms or... well, levels, that the player will have to progress through.

## Considerations

Now, it's time to look at the stuff we should probably consider when designing our game environment.

1. Rules of The World
2. Interactions: Magical or Realistic?
3. What Can The Characters Do?
4. Does Each Level Have a Theme?
5. What Will The Themes Be?
6. What Is The Overall Visual Style and Color Scheme?

## Types of Game Environments

This is where the weight of this chapter lies. At least, for my fingers. Sigh.


### Outdoor Environments
A very popular environment of choice. However, it's not without challenges. Places like *entire cities or villages* can be *very large* and even taxing. A good example of this is Marvel's Spider-Man, which gives the player the freedom to explore and complete side quests.

We're not far enough into the future where we can render an entire city with our computer, though. Rendering and general computing limits forces the developers to *limit gameplay and exploration* in certain ways. In a city environment, they could use roadblocks or debris to act as a "No passing through this point" in the game.



### Indoor Environment
They're different, but indoor environments do have their own set of constraints. Creating doors, walls, ceilings and other props that look realistic is easier, but if you're not careful with them, the room could look extremely cramped.

To create a proper indoor environment, you're gonna need to plan this out properly. Should every room have an interactive door/window? How do you prevent repetition? 

Well, a potential solution would be to add in some extra items or moving characters in or between the rooms. In an indoor environment where everything is static, this could have a very good impact.

Of course, that's only one solution. Feel free to come up with your own.



### Fantasy Environment
You might think these would be the easiest. I mean, fantasy? Can't you do literally anything in fantasy?

Well, think again. Actually, maybe, don't think *too much*. If you let your imagination run a bit too crazy and silly, your environment and levels are gonna look and feel *disorganised and unconnected*.

Good fantasy environments still have some footing on reality just to maintain believability. Mixing these familiar and unfamiliar aspects into a game environment can create an air of mystery and discovery. Just keep in mind, you gotta maintain a good balance between fantasy and reality.

# Part 2 - Depth Cues

I can't believe we're only at part two...

Anyway, depth cue is basically the illusion of three-dimensionality (3D) as seen by the viewer. We can exploit these to create a sense of 3D depth in a 2D environment.

# Depth Cues

These are basically the illusion of three-dimensionality perceived by the viewer. 


## Size

This helps in the illusion of depth if the viewer is aware of the object's actual size. It is closely related to our ability to determine distance.

A common technique in concept art is to place a player or some sort of human in there, so that other objects have a scale.


## Height

In general, objects closer to the viewer are placed at a lower position on the canvas. 



## Colour

This one relates to vibrance and warmth of colors, specifically. The general principle is that the more vibrant a color is, the closer the object is perceived to be.

Air particles in the atmosphere manipulate the color of the environment, especially when certain parts are much further away. That's why things further away kinda look muted, or blending in with the sky. 

On the other hand, things that are closer have warmer colors, and high contrast.



## Texture

Everything has texture. Roads are bumpy, metals are (mostly) smooth, yada-yada.

Essentially, the closer an object is to you, the more detail you are able to see, the more of it's texture you can perceive. 



## Lighting

Light and Shadows help separate objects from each other, and are a great indicator of 3D spaces. 



## Overlap

Overlap is a great, simple (and honestly, obvious) way of showing depth.

When you have two objects in your line of sight, the object covering the other is the closer. When you have a tennis ball right in front of you, and there's a building way further, the tennis ball will cover and overlap the building. That's how we know the tennis ball is closer (among other things)



## Perspective

Geometrical shapes in a 3D space establish an imaginary perspective grid that leads into a singularity, a single point in space that is inescapable, one that will come for us all, crushing everything into nothingness...

This is called a vanishing point.

Take this as an example.

Things that are closer to the vanishing point can usually be considered further away.

## Focus

The _Depth of Field_ is an optical illusion where the area outside of the viewer's focus is blurred. This blurriness can give a sense of distance.

A higher DoF would enable us to see the whole image in focus, while a lower DoF will result in a blurry backdrop, with some elements in the foreground being blurred alongside.

# Part 3 - Composition Tips


## Rule of Thirds
This one states that important elements in an art piece should be placed along one-third points along the canvas. Additionally, if there are more than one intended focus points, place them on opposite sides of the grid.

![[8d27fef1bb906fd3e869759c69827659.jpg]]


## Background, Midground, Foreground
Elements in a composition can be layered according to the above. In a typical concept art, the focus should be in the midground.

It's important that [[5 - Environment Design#Depth Cues|depth cues]] are applied properly to distinguish one layer from the other.


## Framing
This is essentially where you place elements around the focus point of the image, creating a sort of "frame".

![[Dan-Scott-Queenstown-High-Contrast-16x12-Inches-Oil-2019-700W-Medium.jpg]]

Woah, that's a big image. 

Anyway, you can see how the trees create a frame for the focus, in a way, keeping your eyes in the composition and moving your attention towards its focus. Common framing elements are, like in the above, trees. You could also use vignetting.

This leads us to...


## Movement
We can use big imaginary shapes and lines in our art to draw the viewer's focus to a specific point. Of course, it's important that our lines all lead us to the intended focus point.

# Part 4 - Building Game Environments

Here, we're getting into actually building the game environment. If the title didn't give that away.

## Research
Of course, just like we learned in GC, it's important that we do a bit of research just so we know what game environment we actually want.

We can organise our research into 4 main, important categories:

- Real-world equivalent of our intended environment
- Objects commonly found in said environment
- Our spin on the topic
- Mood n' Lighting

For example:

<sub>Yep, taken from the slides again. Sue me.</sub>



## Planning
Now that we've established what we really want, it's time to plan out how we're gonna make our own environment.

We're starting off with planning it, usually involving making sketches or thumbnails.

You could find drawing your ideas helpful. Putting your imagination onto a piece of paper, or into anything else where our eyes can fully comprehend it, can really help us understand what we're getting into, as well as how the environment's objects are formed and how they work. Because, apparently, our eyes are helpful. Who knew?

When we're doing this, it's good to prioritise a top-down view, drawing shapes and forms of buildings and objects. This would help us understand what we're making even better. Moreso if we're making a 3D game.


## Environment Layout...
...is an isometric schematic sketch of an area. This can range from being a room in a map, or even a whole area.

The point of this is to facilitate level design discussions. Later on, we could make more refined versions of this to guide us when it comes to modelling, texturing, set dressing, etc.

A good sketch should have accurate perspective and scale, as well as clear indication of important items or gameplay events.



# Part 4.5 - The Process
...usually follows this workflow:

1. Understand The Brief
2. Planning
3. Production
4. Asset Integration


## Understand The Brief
 Our parents, teachers and even papers themselves told us to read the instructions carefully. And they're right, it's important. Some of you might know this all too well from today's <sub>(28/11)</sub> test earlier... I know I do...

Anyway, it's really important we analyse and understand the brief that was given to us. Take in the genre, theme and art style they want us to make.

We should also conduct some research about other games that fall under the same style as we are. Don't, like, be a blatant copy, though. Unless you wanna get in trouble.


## Planning (Again)
This is where we make sketches and thumbnails (again) of our environment, all while keeping in track of what we've researched. It would be great if we could nail down our measurements and dimensions of the layout, too. 

Here, we'd also determine the relationship of objects with others in the layout, such as distance, location, etc.


## Production
Now we're workin'! Here is where we start making our necessary environment elements, such as walls, doors, terrain, etc. all according to the correct proportions, which we can figure out with the [[5 - Environment Design#Planning (Again)|measurements and dimensions we took in the Planning stage.]] 

If we're making a 3D game, we'll need to unwrap UVs and make textures. If needed, we should also do some baking for the texture maps, occlusion and normal maps too.



## Asset Integration
Finally, we get to import our assets into the game engine. Here, we're gonna need to create and apply materials onto the objects and add components like Rigidbodies and colliders, for testing.

It would also be fantastic if we could test for scale and proportions of the environment and the objects, and ensure that they all fit within the given art direction.

And, that's it! You have built an Environment.
