"From retrospective points of view  
It's time to reinvent  
Don't care to what extent"
<sup>Last Dinosaurs - Zoom</sup>

#### Within Chapter 2 We will be going through 3 Main Points with Sub-points. The 3 Points include:

 ***Parameters, Attributes, Outcome***


#### *PARAMETERS:* 
**(Think of it as ingredients for your dish{Artworks} when you are cooking)**


***PARAMETERS | DESIGN (SHAPE):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231435.png]]

The use of different shapes can help establish a quick read of the object. 

*The following are some of the usual patterns found in games! : (Shape: Character, Environment)*

Circle: Friend, Safe
Rectangle: Mentor, Obstacle
Triangle: Villain, Hazard/Dangerous

---

***PARAMETERS | DESIGN (SIZE):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231446.png]]

Size, an effective parameter to establish power in an object. Typically, the bigger the enemy the more powerful it is.

For UI Design, size is critical in indicating important UI such as HP as it would be the biggest UI element on the screen.

----

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (HUE):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231459.png]]

Hue, often used as a simile for the term colour and refers to the dominant wavelength of colour out of the colours positioned around a colour wheel.

For Example:

- The hue of navy is blue. 
- The hue of burgundy is red. 
- The hue of emerald is green.


Common Perceptions about certain hues:

***Red objects are usually hazards while blue and green objects heal the players.***


***Hue is a great tool in grouping similar objects together. In games, objects belonging to the same faction usually share the same hue.***

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (SATURATION):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231522.png]]

Saturation, the quality of the colour’s purity or intensity.

Effective control of saturation can help draw attention to certain elements within the game scene.

***!Note! :*** You can reduce the saturation of a colour by adding grey or a colour on the opposite side of the opposite side of the colour wheel, essentially killing the colour.

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Value):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231537.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241126231553.png]]

Value, the brightness or darkness of a colour. 
Humans perceive values first over Hue and Saturation.

This makes it very important to constantly check the values of the rendered image


***!Note!:*** Areas of high value contrast should be reserved for interactive elements on the screen.

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering***

How does Hue / Saturation / Value translate to a colour picker?

![[Pasted image 20241126215623.png]]

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Colour Schemes):*** 



Colour Scheme, is used to describe the overall selection of colours in an artwork.


*Major colour schemes in art includes:*

- Analogous
- Complementary
- Split-Complimentary
- Triadic
- Monochromatic


---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Analogous Colour Scheme):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231757.png]]

An Analogous(A-Ne-LOW-GUS) Colour Scheme uses colours next to each other on the colour wheel.

*Examples can include*; blues and greens, or oranges and yellows. these colours have a close relationship with each other.


***!Note!:*** There is not that much hue contrast between analogous colours, so you need to make sure you are creating enough contrast using the other elements like value or saturation.

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Complementary Colour Scheme):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231808.png]]

A Complementary Colour Scheme uses colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel.
When placed next to each other, there is an extremely strong contrasting and vibrant effect.

***!Note! :*** One of the colours of the Complementary Colour Scheme is Selected as the Dominant Colour, this usually means that the Opposite Colour is used as an accent and to add finer details.

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Split-Complementary Colour Scheme):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231852.png]]

A Split-Complementary Colour Scheme utilizes a base colour and two secondary colours.
Vaguely similar to a Complementary Colour Scheme but one of its complements are split.

This colour scheme offers the same advantages of a complementary colour scheme in terms of contrast and balance between warm and cool colour temperatures.

*Fun Fact! :* Some consider it easier to work with since the hues are more nuanced and create less tension.

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Triadic Colour Scheme):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231907.png]]

A triadic colour scheme utilizes colours which are evenly spaced on the colour wheel.
This makes for a very vibrant colour combination.


***!Note! :*** Creating balance is crucial when using a triadic colour scheme. One colour should be dominant while the other two are complementary.

---

***PARAMETERS | Rendering (Monochromatic Colour Scheme):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241126231917.png]]

A monochromatic colour scheme utilizes just one colour with varying levels of saturation and value.


Example:
Tiny Dangerous Dungeons. A game where it uses different shades and tints of a green colour that is especially associated with games developed for a classic Game Boy console.

---

#### ATTRIBUTES:
**(Think of it as the food you produced from the ingredients[Parameters])**


***Attributes | Exaggeration:***

![[Pasted image 20241126231947.png]]

To some degree, exaggeration can be found in design and rendering in almost every game. 
Even a game like GTA, set in a fictitious city much like ours, featuring over-the-top characters.

An Exaggeration involves playing with shape and silhouettes, and either simplifying or emphasizing details to create stylized designs.

---

***Attributes | Hierarchy:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232020.png]]

Elements with an object should be organised in a meaningful way that sets to aid in visual hierarchy.

The Human Eye first perceives shapes before zooming into the medium secondary shapes and the small tertiary shapes.

***!Note! :*** Having too many primary shapes will lead to boredom and having too many tertiary shapes will lead to visual noise.

---

***Attributes | Flow:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232027.png]]

Visual Flows helps to guide the player's  towards what the artist wants them to see. this could be a trap, a treasure or an in-game objective.

These flow lines can either be explicit or implied. If there are no flow lines, a work will become disjointed, or chaotic.

---

***Attributes | Stereotype:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232036.png]]

Game artists leverage on players’ prior knowledge to create quick reads on their design.

 
Examples would include:

Designing a tank character? Just start with a rectangle shape. 
A Hazard? Draw pointy edges.


HOWEVER, foolishly following  these stereotypes may lead to an unoriginal and thus, unmemorable design. 

That's why it is key to exercise everything in moderation!


---

***Attributes | Style:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232046.png]]

Referring to this chapter, Style usually refers to the way visuals are represented on the screen.

This is determined by the characteristics that describe the visuals, such as form and colour choices.


Style, Think of style as the flavour that you are adding onto your artwork. When you apply it creatively, it can help make your game stand out from the crowd.


Popular Art styles include:

- Realism
- Cel-Shaded
- Pixel Art
- Low-Poly Styles

---

***Attributes | Style: (Visual Styles Within Games)***

!Important Note! : 
while game art styles do not have a clear and officially recognized taxonomy, game developers still distinguish some key categories based on the combination of their most characteristic features.


---

***Visual Styles In Games | Pixel:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232113.png]]

First, What are pixels? 
Pixels are the individual building blocks of digital images, represented by a tiny square block.
Typically, hundreds or thousands of these pixels are combined to form a single object.


!Note! :
Pixel art tends to remind people of early video games and thus gives players a sense of nostalgia. This art style is still highly popular even in modern releases such as Stardew valley etc. .

---

***Visual Styles In Games | Cel-Shaded:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232125.png]]

Use of Cel-Shading?
Artists use cel-shading to make 3D models and objects seem flat and 2D.
It is a way of displaying characters and environments using non-photorealistic rendering to mimic hand-drawing with hard contours and sharp lighting transitions.

This style is usually characterised by having little to no gradients


----

***Visual Styles In Games | Realism:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232134.png]]

The Aim:
Realistic art styles aim to ground a game in reality.
Artists will create graphics that display the characters and environment in the most realistic way as close as possible to real life.


Many horror and survival games use realism to create stronger immersion for players within the game world.


---

***Visual Styles In Games | Low Poly:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232145.png]]

Low poly art usually looks like a bunch of triangles.
In low poly, the games do not use anti-aliasing, which means each polygon, and thus every hard edge, is visible. 
They also use solid colours instead of textures.



The focus in low poly is on the materials and shape of the model and stage lighting.
The complexity of low poly artwork varies, but they are primarily minimalistic.


---

#### OUTCOMES
**The intended result of the attributes.**


***Outcomes | Clarity:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232155.png]]

Events in fast paced action games can go by in a blink of an eye.
Therefore, it is crucial to ensure clarity of the visuals on screen.
A Good control of clarity can minimize player confusion and frustration.


There are rare occasions where clarity is not desired.

An Example would be:
The case of misdirection leading to a plot twist later on.

---

***Outcomes | Immersion:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232201.png]]

One of the key objectives of games is to make the players believe  that they are in a real, living and breathing world.

To achieve the intended immersion:
Developers have to create an overall mood and balance the different attributes to fit into the laws of the game world.

----

***Outcomes | Appeal:***

![[Pasted image 20241126232210.png]]

It would be a shame if no one is interested in playing the game. 
Therefore, good to know the target audience well.

A photorealistic game with realistic physics will mean absolutely nothing if you are targeting the casual audience. So there is a need to change things up to fit the casual audience.
