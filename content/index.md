Again, most of this was reference was from the slides. Sorry for the lateness, but I'm honestly surprised we managed to do this at all. I know at least one of you are gonna make use of it, and that makes it worth it. If there's anything wrong, or you're unsure of anything, refer to the slides to make sure, or contact us about it~!

Guys, unexpectedly we made it. These notes are not perfect, so if you encounter errors, it's just a mistake. You could always just refer back to the slides.
