Welcome Back! Let's delve deeper into UI/UX into Games. But, UI/UX... What do they mean in terms of games?

#### 3 Main Topics That Will Be Covered:

- ***User Interface***
- ***User Experience***
- ***Design Workflow***
#### Definition of UI & UX within Games

***UI(User Interface):***

UI, the **visual presentation of information**. Basically, **the visual design of the information**

***UI(In Terms of Games):***

In Games, UI **can encompass different menu screens, loading screens, pause menus and the HUD(Heads-Up-Display).**

---

***UX(User Experience):***

UX, **takes into account the player's feelings when they play/interact with the game.**

Examples:
whether the controls are responsive, is there any visual feedback when the player hovers the cursor over a button, etc.


TLDR; **The Organization & Transition of the Information.**


Good UI & UX Are Equally Important In Presenting Clear and Intuitive Information

---

#### UI, User Interface... Buttons and Such?

From the definition of UI, we know that it is the visual presentation of information.

But in this Section , we will be going through the different types of screens and CIA(You'll Know more later onwards).

---

***User Interface - Types of Screens (Splash Screens):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241127090433.png]]

Splash Screen, **a screen the player typically sees at the start of the game.**

Did You Know: Traditionally, the function of the splash screen is to introduce the title of the game.

For Multiplayer/Online Games, the splash screen would be replaced with a login screen

---

***User Interface - Types of Screens (Loading Screens):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241127091042.png]]

Loading Screen, **a loading screen is used to inform the player that the game is playing**

***!Important Note! :*** 
It is **important to have elements on the loading screen that are constantly animating**.

An example is **a spinning circle or a scrolling texture on the loading bar.** This is to indicate that the game is still running.

**!Note! :** Helpful tips are advised to be put in the loading screens for the player to read, for games with longer loading times

---

***User Interface - Types of Screens (Main Menu):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241127091448.png]]

Main Menu, think of the main menu as **a cross-junction on the road, directing the player to different features of the games** such as:

- ***New Game***
- ***Save/Load Game***
- ***Options***
- ***Quit***


**Fun Fact !:** 
Some of the above options, like “Save/Load Game” and “Options” may lead the player to another page that has a similar menu interface.

---

***User Interface - Types of Screens (Heads-Up-Display[HUD]):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241127092947.png]]

HUD, Present on the screen during Gameplay. Making it **Crucial that the HUD is unobtrusive to the player and most of the information should be positioned at the peripherals of the screen.**


Common Information on the HUD differs game to game but includes:

***•Health Points indicator***
***•Magic Points indicator / Ammo count***
***•Game / Level time***
***•Collectibles / Currency / Points / Score***
***•Available skills / spells***
***•Available equipment***
***•Mini-map***
***•Cursor / Cross-hair***

---

***User Interface - Types of Screens (Pause Menu):*** 

![[Pasted image 20241127092956.png]]

Pause Menu, **a screen where the player can access the main menu commands while in-game.** 
**This means that the layout and buttons are usually the same as the main menu.**

!Note! : 
Additional features found in a pause menu (that differ from the main menu) typically include the option to restart from an earlier checkpoint, the mission progress/objective and other tips for the player.

---

***User Interface - Types of Screens (Other Screen):*** 

Other UI Screen,  **may or may not be present in the game depending on the genre.** Other common screens include:

***•Game win / Level complete***
***•Game over***
***•Credits***
***•Shop / Unlock menu***

---

#### CIA (Clarity)

***User Interface - CIA (CLARITY):***

![[Pasted image 20241127102942.png]]

With enough clarity, **players should be able to quickly retrieve whatever information they need to proceed with gameplay.**


***!Important Note! :***
the user interface should not be the focal point and therefore it should be designed to streamline the information retrieving process.


This can be accomplished using the following:

***•Size***
***•Position***
***•Contrast***
***•Font***
***•Symbolism***

---

***User Interface - Clarity (Size):***

![[

**Size** is very important in Games, Because **the Most important UI elements  should occupy the largest amount of screen space.**

An Example is Diablo 3. The most important information is the character’s health and mana. Therefore, these are the largest UI elements on the screen.

---

***User Interface - Clarity (Position):***



**Position** is also important for UI, Because **they are arranged near the peripherals of the screen.**

Why? T**o ensure that it is always out of the way of the gameplay and does not obstruct the player’s view.**

---

***User Interface - Clarity (Contrast):***



**Our Eyes are drawn to areas with high visual contrasts.** Because of this, **Important UI tend to be high in hue/ saturation and value contrast**. Achieved through **using highly saturated colours, stroke effects and glow effects for text.**

---

***User Interface - Clarity (Font):***



It is **important to note the font's legibility**, like if its easily readable etc.

When Downloading what you feel are cool looking fonts, its important that these **fancy fonts tend to have poor legibility at smaller font sizes**

And a Good thing to keep in mind is to **limit the number of fonts on the screens to 3 or less.**





***Kerning:***

![[

The **Adjusting of spaces between the individual characters of a word.**

This **creates a balanced visual outcome**



***Leading:***

![[

The **spacing between the lines of type in a body of text.**

Playing a major role in **readability and improving the overall appearance of the text and making it easier for the reader to follow**



***Serif vs Sans-Serif:***



Two of the most common typeface classifications.

**Serif** gives a **more traditional** whereas **Sans-Serif** is becoming more popular in the 19th century and **considered more modern**.

---

***User Interface - Clarity (Symbolism):***

Pictures speaks a thousand words.
**Appropriate symbols and colours can effectively replace text for UI design.**

The icons are **meant to be simple and able to be recognized and understood immediately.**

---

#### CIA (Immersion) 

***User Interface - CIA (IMMERSION):***

Great UI are **usually Invisible.** The Characters in the game wouldn't be able to see the information like health bars, damage counters and tooltips etc.  

In order to make a game world more believable,  Its important to mask out the UI elements considering 2 Factors:

- ***Unobtrusive***
- ***Diegetic vs Non-Diegetic*** 

---

***User Interface - Immersion (Unobtrusive):***

**UI Shouldn't take centre stage unless its rhythm, card or simulation games.**

Therefore there is **no need to crowd the screen with too many UI elements.**

---

***User Interface - Immersion (Diegetic vs Non-Diegetic):***

First of what is diegetic or non-diegetic?


Diegetic: 
means that it is **part of the scene.**

Examples; Dashboard in GT 

Non-Diegetic:
means that it is **not part of the scene.**

Examples; Floating health bars above every unit in League of Legends



This **does not mean diegetic presentation is always the best.**

**Diegetic is more subtle and may act against the player** as the information is **not  as immediate as a non-diegetic one.**


---

#### CIA (Appeal)

***User Interface - CIA (APPEAL):***

While UI is **usually functional**, a good looking/ **visually appealing UI still adds to the overall product.**


***User Interface - Appeal(Theme):***

**Blizzard's Hearthstone** is a great example for this. A reason why hearthstone prevailed over other digital card games during its launch period is because of its outstanding UI.

The UI simulates the fantasy of flipping through a book of cards and duelling opponents in a tavern setting.

---

#### UX, User Experience... Dead ends are not needed right?

***User Experience Flowchart:***

Why use a Flowchart?
A flowchart is used to **describe the logical relationship between different screens of a game.**
An **easy to create, simple document that  solves a lot of fundamental UI issues**

---

### CIA for UX

***User Experience - Clarity:***

Because there are **a lot of factors that can make the player feel frustrated when playing a game.**

The role of the UI artist is to **ensure the player does not feel frustrated when navigating the interface** using Two Factors:

- ***Clear Instructions***
- ***No "Dead-Ends"***

---

***User Experience - Clarity (Clear Instructions):***

With Clear Instructions, it **gives the players clear instructions on how to proceed from one screen to another or from one gameplay moment to the next** and this can be achieved from something as simple as a button prompt.


**For console games**, it is **crucial to indicate which button on the controller is used to confirm and which button is used to cancel when navigating the menus.**

---

***User Experience - Clarity (No Dead-Ends):***

Why is having No-Dead-Ends Important?

Its **important because you can conduct UI usability testing as soon as possible and during these playtests**, its **best to ensure that there are no “dead ends” in the UI**.

"Dead Ends "refer to **screens that have no way to proceed or backtrack to another screen** and a simple mistake like not including a "Go Back Button" results in a Dead End.

This may seem trivial but, this is **usually categorized as a “game-breaking bug” as the player has to force quit the game, potentially losing any unsaved data.**

---

***User Experience - Immersion:***

Navigation of UI and Gameplay should be a cohesive experience making the **learning curve of the UI little to none.** This means that **once the player is familiar with the UI, they should not have to think twice when executing a specific command that he has in mind.**

Two factors to consider to achieve this:

***•Input device***
***•Standardization***

---

***User Experience - Immersion (Input Device):***

Input Device:
**The machine the player operates to interact with the objects on the screen.**

The following are input devices found  in the game industry (System: Input Device):

***PC: Keyboard + Mouse***
***Console: Game Controller***
***Mobile: Touch***

---

***User Experience - Immersion (Input Device: PC):***

Keyboard and Mouse **offers a wide range of movement input options for the players.**

Players **can customize their key binds.** Players can bind keys to certain commands that they often use, and **the mouse offers a flexible movement of the cursor**.

This means that there are **less restrictions when it comes to the placement of buttons in the UI** as the **player can simply move his mouse and click on the button anywhere on the screen.**

---

***User Experience - Immersion (Input Device: Consoles):***

**More Limited Range of movements as compared to mouse.**
Because of this, it is often **better to organize buttons into a single column or row for easier navigation for console games.**


Typing with a controller is also extremely tedious. Therefore, a chat wheel with predefined options is often used in multiplayer console games.

---

***User Experience - Immersion (Input Device: Mobile):***

**Most straightforward and intuitive option.**

**little to none learning curve.**

The main issue with designing for a mobile device is that **screen space is limited**. **Each button has to be big enough for an average adult finger to press on and small enough for it to not clutter up the gameplay area.**

Another thing to note will be **whether the game is running in portrait or landscape mode.**


---

***User Experience - Immersion (Standardization):***

**Crucial to set standard rules for the player to follow when navigating the UI.**

Example:
pressing “O” on the PS5 controller confirms the selection and “X” cancels the selection. At every point in the game, that interaction has to stay consistent.


This also **applies to the standardization of colour application. it can include symbols, font choices, button placement and behaviours.**

Examples:
red always means cancel, green always means confirm

---

***User Experience - Appeal:***

An Appealing UI Experience is **one that is fun to navigate and interact with.**

The player should find **joy and enjoyment while moving around the menus and screens**. This is **where good use of audio and visual effects comes into play.**

Two Factors are to be taken into consideration:

***•Transitions***
***•Feedback***

---

***User Experience - Appeal (Transitions):***

**Adding appropriate animations during the transition between two UI screens can make the process more enjoyable.**

It is good to **minimize the duration of such transitions as a five second transition between gameplay and the pause menu** may look cool for the first time, but will be **unbearable to sit through for the 100th time.**

---

***User Experience - Appeal (Feedback):***

**Appropriate audio and visual effects should be used as a form of feedback for the player when he executes a command on the UI.** 

This feedback can be **as simple as a mouse-over sound clip and button effect to something as extravagant as the opening of a loot box.**

---

#### Design Work Flow

3 Main Topics in DWF:

- ***Research***
- ***Design*** 
- ***Prototype***



***Design Work Flow - Research:***

Objective: 
To **build a visual library**. Allowing you to **make more informed decisions with regards to the design and rendering of your artwork.**

In general, the **more images you can pool together, the easier it is for you to produce new ideas**.

To **ensure relevancy of your research**, you may organize your research materials into the following categories:

***•Symbolic representation of game’s theme***
***•Button styles***
***•Font choices***
***•Colour schemes***

___

***Design Work Flow - Design:***

Step One: **Create a flowchart of the entire project**. From here, using a **software like Photoshop or Illustrator, start to create multiple artboards that correspond to the screens you have on the flowchart.** Use the **appropriate canvas size based on the system you are designing for.**

**At the beginning** of the design process, you want to **tackle the big picture issues first**. **Pay attention to the placement and size of each UI element.**

At this phase, you may want to **use placeholder text or graphics to simulate the amount of space that information will take up on the screen.**

---

***Design Work Flow - Prototype:***

A prototype is **an early sample, model, or release of a product built for the purpose of testing a concept or process.**

**Once the initial wireframe sketch is created**, you can **port it over to a prototype software.** There are many on the market right now, such as Adobe XD and Figma.

**Once the prototype is done**, **conduct a usability test to see if users can navigate between screens without issues.**

From here, it is a **back-and-forth process between design-prototype-testing until you arrive at the final design.**
