"I'm falling down the rabbit hole again, yeah"
<sup>Last Dinosaurs - Apollo</sup>


Ever played a game and wondered; "Wow! This is Awesome", "This environment looks Insane!" etc.

Well DYK, everything from the artwork in-game, cutscenes and the buttons You the Viewer  interacts with are all game assets? Even the smallest pixels are well though out!



### We all know games right? It can be Categorised into 3 kinds; 
### 2D GAMES, 3D GAMES AND 2.5D GAMES!


So then what are the <b>Core Differences between them?</b> 


#### First up we have 2D vs 3D Games!

![[Pasted image 20241126230601.png]]

But before that **What is a 2D Game and a 3D Game?**;

2D GAME:

A ***2 Dimensional Game*** is a game that ***uses two-dimensional graphics such as sprites, tiles, vector art to represent the Gameworld and characters within the world.***

3D GAME:

A ***3 Dimensional Game*** is a game that ***uses three-dimensional graphics such as polygons, textures  and models to create a more realistic and immersive environment.***

#### Now that we know what they are, What are the differences?

***To Put it Simply:*** 

 <b>2D Games: Simpler and More Stylized || 3D Games: More Complex and Realistic.</b>


#### Up Next we have 2.5D Games! 

![[Pasted image 20241126230649.png]]

"Psst... Some Say 2.5D Games Have a mix of 2D and 3D Games!"

Which you are right stranger!


2.5D Game:

A 2.5D Game is ***a Hybrid Game of 2D Games and 3D Games***. This is ***because it combines elements from both 2D and 3D games.***

***Some Examples are:***

*2.5D Games that use 3D Graphics with a fixed perspective* || *3D Games that use 2D Graphics for the UI(User Interface) or the BG(Background)*



#### Characteristics of the 3 Games

So then, Now that we know the definitions of all 3 games and somewhat know what they are. What makes the unique?

--------- --------- -------- ---------- -------- --------- -----------

CHARACTERISTICS OF A 2D GAME:

![[Pasted image 20241126230729.png]]

These games uses ***sprites***, which ***do not have three dimensional geometry***.

These sprites are ***drawn as flat images*** as the ***camera is (orthographic) or in simpler terms (has no perspective).***

__________________________________________________________________________

CHARACTERISTICS OF A 3D GAME:

![[Pasted image 20241126230744.png]]

These games ***makes use of three dimensional geometry***. ***Materials and Textures are rendered onto the surface of the 3D models*** and as a result ***making them appear as solid environments, characters and objects that make up the game world.***

These games ***render the scene using perspective***, this means that ***the closer an object is to the screen the larger the object.***

__________________________________________________________________________

CHARACTERISTICS OF A 2.5D GAME:

![[Pasted image 20241126230800.png]]

In some cases 2D Games do uses 3D Geometry for the Environment and Characters but this restricts the gameplay to 2 Dimensions.

Example:

The camera may show a side-scrolling view, but the player only moves in two dimensions.

For these games, the 3D effect serves more of a visual than functional purpose


Other cases include games that simulates 3D Geometry and a depth axis, this requires the use of the orthographic camera instead of a perspective one. A common technique giving the player a bird's eye view of the game action or in simpler terms (An Isometric View).





#### Now onto Game Art Pipeline!

Phew that was some work! Now onto the GAP. which consists of;

***Pre-Production:***

ART DIRECTION
CONCEPT ART

__________________________________________________________________________

WHATS AN ART DIRECTION?

![[Pasted image 20241126230927.png]]

It is the process of generating drawings, paintings and research materials to define the art style of the game.


Fun Fact !:  

A clear art direction will unify the look of the game, ensuring that the art assets created by different artists in the team feel cohesive in the context of the game’s world. 

----

WHAT'S CONCEPT ART THEN?

![[Pasted image 20241126230953.png]]

Concept Art, a form of illustration used to convey an idea of what the final art of the game will look like.

Fun Fact !: 

Artists go through an iterative process by trying out different design options, filtering and finally refining them to a final stage.

---

WHAT ARE CHARACTER SPRITES?

![[Pasted image 20241126231026.png]]

For 2D Games,  artists will have to create different views of the characters (e.g., front, back, side, etc.) and their different states (e.g., attack, run, jump, etc.).

After that, those sprites are packed into a Spritesheet. Sprites sheets are typically in the dimensions of the power of 2, e.g. 64px x 64px , 128px x 128px etc. .

---

ENVIRONMENT TILES... IT MAKES THE ENVIRONMENTS RIGHT?

![[Pasted image 20241126231034.png]]

These environment art assets are typically generated as tiles. Tiles are modular, meaning that they can be mixed and combined with other tiles in different situations.

This reduces the work needed for artists through repeated use of assets, as well as improving the game efficiency by reading from a single image set.

---

UI/UX... INFO AND XPERIENCE OF USER RIGHT?

![[Pasted image 20241126231045.png]]

You should know what are UI and UX roughly by now right? But what about in the case of games?


UI(User Interface):

UI, a Visual Presentation of information. In games, it encompasses the menu screens, pause menu and the HUD(Heads UP DISPLAY)



UX(User Experience):

UX, Takes into consideration the player's feelings when they are playing/interacting with the game. This may include if the controls are responsive or if there is visual feedback  when player hovers over a button etc. .

---

3D MODELS.... POLYGONS, FACES ERR RIGHTT?

![[Pasted image 20241126231059.png]]

We definitely have experience in this since we did this for project. But what is it mean within GAP(Game Art Pipeline)?


3D MODELS:

These models are made up of polygons, points and edges, used to create various in game assets such as: Characters, Vehicles, Weapons, Environment


Fun Fact !:

3D modelling for games requires an understanding of geometry, topology, and other technical aspects of 3D graphics, as well as proficiency in using 3D modelling software(Blender, Maya).

---

3D TEXTURES... MMMM TEXTURING UV MAPS ETC SOME LIKE THAT?

![[Pasted image 20241126231143.png]]

Again, We definitely have experience in this since we did this for project. But what is it mean within GAP(Game Art Pipeline)?

3D Textures:

A texture is a bitmap image, usually in the form of a JPG or PNG, that produces detailed and complex characteristics.

3D Texturing is the process of adding textures onto the three-dimensional space of your 3D model. This can be done through the use of photos for a photorealistic effect, or painted from scratch.

---

3D RIGGING & ANIMATION, THINK OF THIS AS HOW YOUR GAME CHARACTERS MOVE.

![[Pasted image 20241126231200.png]]

3D Rigging:

Rigging, a technique used in skeletal animation where you add control to a model, which defines the range of movement.

Rigging uses a series of interconnected bones are applied to the 3D model so that you can move and manipulate it in your desired manner(Any way you like basically).


3D Animation:

However, Animation is different. During Animation, the different poses of the 3D Model you made from rigging are captured at different time frames. And when played, the model moves through the different poses, blending into an animated movement.

---

PARTICLE EFFECTS... EXPLOSIONS, BLEEDING, BURNING?

 ![[Pasted image 20241126231240.png]]

Particle Effects:

PE(Particle Effects), one of the simplest ways to provide visual feedback to the player.

Positive particle effects can give the player a sense of reward and entice them to continue playing.


---

MARKETING ART... LIKE PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND SUCH?

![[Pasted image 20241126231252.png]]

News about the Gaming Market:

In today’s saturated market, it is important to create awareness of the existence of the product. As such, developers are going out of their way to promote their games, allocating as much as 30 - 50% of their development budget.


In Order to promote the game virally, companies do twitch streams, attend conventions, maintain a social media presence and a blog just to name a few common techniques companies use to promote their games.


Marketing Art:

These Marketing Arts exists in various forms such as: illustrations, videos website graphics etc. .
